# Hey, I'm Kunal 👋

A software developer with 3+ years of experience building production-grade systems using React, Node.js, TypeScript, Java, Spring Boot, and Azure.

I care about scalability and clean system design. Outside of work, I enjoy learning how things work, whether it’s distributed systems or everyday life.
